  I love iOS development. I hate web development. In fact, all of the color drains from my face and my eye starts twitching at the idea of building a website, but this was pretty painless. Want something like this for yourself? <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">Joshua Lande</a> has a nice description of how to get started.

####The Blog
I'm an iOS developer from Raleigh, NC. This is where I put things about development that I want to remember later.

####The Author
I've been an iOS developer for various startups since 2011. I cut my teeth on C and C++ a long time ago. Object Oriented Programming was a new-ish thing. I majored in Computer Science. The bubble burst. I majored in everything else. I decided I should graduate. I got an internship. I wrote myself into obsolescence with a C# utility. I majored in CSC again. I got a job developing mobile games. I joined a startup as the sole iOS dev. I took a wrong turn into SEO. I joined my current startup as the second iOS dev. I decided to start a blog.

And here I am.

More recently, I've been trying to wrap my head around functional programming since it's become a new-ish thing for mainstream languages. And by "it's become a new-ish thing for mainstream languages", I mean "Apple released Swift, which employs functional concepts". I admit my propensity for being an [Architecture Astronaut](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html), but [since OOP seems to be losing favor](http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/object-oriented-programming-is-an-expensive-disaster-which-must-end), I don't feel quite so bad for not having read the entirety of the Gang of Four book. On the other hand, [MVVM is just finding its way to the iOS world](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/mvvm.html), so I'm trying to stay at least in the stratosphere with it.

If you made it this far, thanks, and I hope you find something interesting here.
